# Toxic-comment-classification
This project mainly focus on predicting the toxicity level of the sentence.For example if we give a sentence it predict the toxicity level in these catagories 
threats, obscenity, insults, and identity-based hate.This can be used to categorize comments in twitter or any official website.
The data set for this project is taken form kaggle.
In this project follows the pipeline of mechine learing projects 
1)Data analysis -> Null values are taken care,future engineering tactices are analysed.
2)Future engineering : the sentences are converted into the vectors and padded to level the whole sentences.
3)Future selection : Basically it takes sentences and predicts so we sholuld'nt care about this step as we are not having many features.
4)Model : LSTM model is used in this project. Which is giving pretty good results.
